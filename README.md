Calendrive is a website that allows users to share their own events with others. You can also RSVP to those events, so that others can see how many others are interested in those events.

## Login

In order to log in, users must sign in using their Google account, which will then give them access to post events and RSVP to them.

## Creating Events

![Necessary Information](https://github.com/WVU-CS230-2024-01-Group12/CalenDrive/tree/master/img/info-required.png)

Creating an event is as simple as clicking the `Add Event` button at the top of the screen, then filling in the necessary information and posting.

### Event Information

Events require the following:

- title
- timeframe
- location
- description.

Events can be assigned a location using the search bar built into the `Post Event` box. Using this search bar, you can find the exact location you want with just a few words.

## Viewing Events
